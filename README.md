# InstagramJSONToReadableText
This script can convert messages.json in your Instagram dump to readable separate text files for each user you've chatted with.

Hi There,

  Dumped all of your Instagram data and Downloaded it? Messages.json is unreadable? This Code is Built just for you!
  
  Just place the messages.json file in the same folder as the script and run test.py. You'll find separate .txt files for each user in perfectly readable format.
                  Enjoy!!! Be sure to leave a star and follow me if you like. :)

# Editing The Source Code...
You can edit the source code yourself to suit your own time zone. Just use an IDE or even notepad. The first parameters can be changed but if you consider yourself a good coder feel free to modify the code to your need.
